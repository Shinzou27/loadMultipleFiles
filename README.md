# Load Multiple Files
Short script that allows the user to load all images they want at once.

In order to add this script into your Photoshop, you need to go to your Photoshop folder, enter "Presets" folder then finally enter "Scripts" folder and paste the .jsx file on it.

You can also add it as a macro with the "Actions" feature that you can activate pressing Alt+F9.
